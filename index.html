      <p>I’m a full stack developer from Los Angeles, CA. I pride myself on providing creative solutions to unique problems, and seeing the bigger picture when it comes to the goals of a project. I believe every line of code should serve as an expression of those ambitions. When I’m not coding, I can be found playing tennis, making music with my friends, or geeking out over economic and financial data.</p>

    <p>My primary strength is full stack JavaScript. I am always looking for ways to improve, as well as learn new technologies.</p>

          <p>Pulse allows you to perform real-time sentimental analysis on stocks and cryptocurrencies. Each search provides you with a stream of tweets about what people are saying about that asset right now, as well as an updating sentiment score and graph to chart movements in sentiment. This allows users to predict whether or not the general public is bullish or bearish on an asset at that point in time.</p>

          <p>Whatdo.io (“What Do I Owe?”) provides users a singular source where they can store all the bills and expenses that they share with other people. I often found myself setting reminders or calendar entries to manage these various charges, so I wanted to create a definitive ledger to alleviate this struggle. Users can organize their bills by recurring, one-time, as well as whether or not they are owed to a third-party or owed to them. </p>

          <p>RoadFlix was created for the avid traveller who needs something to watch during the course of their trip. Simply enter your origin and destination, and RoadFlix will calculate the amount of time it will take to drive there, and offer movie suggestions for you to watch during that time. Add movies to your queue, and RoadFlix will tell you once you’ve added enough movies to keep you entertained throughout the entire length of your trip. Happy travels!</p>

    <p>The work I find most fulfilling is that which allows me to implement a wide variety of skills and critical thinking. I have experience in an array of different fields, and I love opportunities where I can combine seemingly unrelated abilities to create something that’s never been done before.</p>
